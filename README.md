# Emojer

Emojer is a twitter clone using only emojis. The goal of this project was the learn the t3 stack. Tech learned along the way were auth with Clerk, prisma with Planet Scale as the DB, and tRPC. Mobile responsiveness is in progress, but app has full functionality to login in and create and see posts.

Prisma broke for app some reason. Something to do with openssl. Working on fixing bug...
